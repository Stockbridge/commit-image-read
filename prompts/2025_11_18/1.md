Perfect! I've successfully reorganized your prompts directory:

• Created a 2025_11_17 folder inside the prompts directory
• Moved and renamed the three files:
• 2025_11_17_1.md → 2025_11_17/1.md
• 2025_11_17_2.md → 2025_11_17/2.md
• 2025_11_17_3.md → 2025_11_17/3.md

The files are now organized in the date-based folder structure you requested.
