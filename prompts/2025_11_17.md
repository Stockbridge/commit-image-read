## Can you read the three files ./images that contain the phrase CommitOnly and describe what you see?

I can see three GitHub-style commit history heatmaps showing different time periods:

22_23_CommitHistory_CommitOnly.png: Shows commit activity from 2022-2023, with most activity concentrated in 2023. The pattern shows consistent daily commits throughout most of 2023, with lighter activity in late 2022.

24_25_CommitHistory_CommitOnly.png: Displays 2024-2025 commit activity. Shows heavy commit activity in early
2025 (January-March), with some activity in late 2024 (November-December). The 2025 portion shows very
dense, consistent daily commits.

23_24_CommitHistory_CommitOnly.png: Covers 2023-2024, showing consistent commit activity throughout 2024
with some gaps. The pattern indicates regular development work with varying intensity levels represented by
different shades of blue.

All three images appear to be GitHub contribution graphs filtered to show only commits (hence "CommitOnly"),
displaying the typical grid format where darker squares indicate more commits on that day. The activity
patterns suggest active development periods with consistent daily contributions.

## can you try and read the first block of commits (2022) from the first file (22-23), and turn it into a JSON object modeled {2022: {[week[1-52]]: {[su|m|t|w|th|f|s]: [0-4]}} }

Looking at the 2022 section from the first image, I can see it shows November and December with a grid
pattern. Let me create the JSON structure based on what's visible:

json
{
"2022": {
"44": {"su": 0, "m": 0, "t": 0, "w": 0, "th": 0, "f": 0, "s": 0},
"45": {"su": 0, "m": 0, "t": 0, "w": 0, "th": 0, "f": 0, "s": 0},
"46": {"su": 0, "m": 0, "t": 0, "w": 0, "th": 0, "f": 0, "s": 0},
"47": {"su": 0, "m": 1, "t": 1, "w": 2, "th": 1, "f": 1, "s": 1},
"48": {"su": 1, "m": 1, "t": 1, "w": 1, "th": 1, "f": 1, "s": 1},
"49": {"su": 1, "m": 1, "t": 1, "w": 1, "th": 1, "f": 1, "s": 1},
"50": {"su": 1, "m": 1, "t": 1, "w": 1, "th": 1, "f": 1, "s": 1},
"51": {"su": 1, "m": 1, "t": 1, "w": 1, "th": 1, "f": 1, "s": 1},
"52": {"su": 1, "m": 1, "t": 1, "w": 1, "th": 1, "f": 1, "s": 1}
}
}

This represents the visible 2022 commit activity where weeks 44-46 show no activity (0), and weeks 47-52
show light to moderate activity (1-2 commits per day based on the blue shading intensity).

# the data shape is correct, but commit spread is not. the first week shoudl be 0,1,1,0,2,1,0.

You're right, let me correct that - week 44 should have the pattern 0,1,1,0,2,1,0:

json
{
"2022": {
"44": {"su": 0, "m": 1, "t": 1, "w": 0, "th": 2, "f": 1, "s": 0},
"45": {"su": 0, "m": 0, "t": 0, "w": 0, "th": 0, "f": 0, "s": 0},
"46": {"su": 0, "m": 0, "t": 0, "w": 0, "th": 0, "f": 0, "s": 0},
"47": {"su": 0, "m": 1, "t": 1, "w": 1, "th": 1, "f": 1, "s": 1},
"48": {"su": 1, "m": 1, "t": 1, "w": 1, "th": 1, "f": 1, "s": 1},
"49": {"su": 1, "m": 1, "t": 1, "w": 1, "th": 1, "f": 1, "s": 1},
"50": {"su": 1, "m": 1, "t": 1, "w": 1, "th": 1, "f": 1, "s": 1},
"51": {"su": 1, "m": 1, "t": 1, "w": 1, "th": 1, "f": 1, "s": 1},
"52": {"su": 1, "m": 1, "t": 1, "w": 1, "th": 1, "f": 1, "s": 1}
}
}

# can you help me build a script that will parse the image colors and squares and fill this shape?

[created ./parse_commits.ts]

The TypeScript script uses the canvas library to read image pixels and map colors to commit levels (0-4).
You'll need to install the dependency:

```
bash
npm install canvas
npm install @types/node
```

The script samples pixel colors from each grid square and maps them to commit intensity levels based on
typical GitHub heatmap colors.

## Can you set up a package.json for this file so the script can be run locally

The package.json includes:
• canvas for your image manipulation
• tsx for TypeScript execution
• @types/node for Node.js type definitions
• A start script for easy execution
