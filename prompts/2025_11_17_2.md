## Can you evaluate folder structure (./) and create a context to help ramp you up when you find yourself in this package?

I'll analyze the folder structure to understand the project and create a helpful context document.
Now let me examine the key files to understand the project better:
Now I'll create a comprehensive context document:

[created PROJECT_Context.md]

I've created a comprehensive PROJECT_CONTEXT.md file that provides a complete overview of your commit-
image-read project. Here's what it covers:

Project Purpose: Analyzes GitHub commit history screenshots and converts them to structured JSON data

Key Components:
• parse_commits.ts - Main parser that extracts commit levels from image pixels
• detect_grids.ts - Grid detection utility for analyzing image structure
• images/ - Contains GitHub contribution graph screenshots (2022-2025)
• prompts/ - Development session logs

Data Structure: Converts visual commit heatmaps to JSON format with year/week/day hierarchy and commit
intensity levels (0-4)

Technical Stack: Uses @napi-rs/canvas for image processing, TypeScript with tsx for execution

This context document will help you (or anyone else) quickly understand the project's purpose, structure,
and how to work with it when returning to the codebase.
